create a docker network
	docker network create my-network
Pull image redis:latest from docker hub and run it in a container in my-network
	docker pull redis:latest
	docker run --name govind-redis --network my-network -it redis:latest
pull image mysql:latest from docker hub and run it in a container in my-network
	docker pull mysql:latest
	docker run --name govind-mysql --network my-network -it mysql:latest
create an image using the Dockerfile in this directory and run the image in my-network
	docker build -t govind-pyapp .
	docker run --name myapp --network my-network -it -p 30001:5000 govind-pyapp
	(-p means run on specified port..here we are mapping 30001 port of base system to 5000 port of docker container)
	(as we are running app.py on 5000 port )
after that u can run the commands in readme.md to verify ur app
alternatively u can access localhost:30001/init  in browser to see whether db initialized
